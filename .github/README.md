###My AI Usage

I responsibly used AI tools to speed up development:

ChatGPT

Helped me prepare a roadmap for my assignmet
Helped draft frontend components (Dashboard, Login, Register), API service wrapppers and write backend api crud operations.
Provided CI/CD pipeline YAML.

GitHub Copilot

Suggested code completions while writing React components and Express routes.
Helped scaffold boilerplate and repetitive logic.
Assisted with debugging TypeScript and test failures.

Reflection

AI significantly accelerated the workflow, especially for boilerplate and testing.
However, all code was reviewed, refactored, and validated manually to ensure correctness and alignment with TDD practices.
Commit history clearly documents AI-assisted commits with Co-authored-by trailers.

Deployment

Frontend: Vercel (https://sweet-shop-management-system-two.vercel.app/register)
Backend: Render (https://sweet-shop-management-system-2-tgzi.onrender.com/)
